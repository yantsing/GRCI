The IEEEtrantools.sty package provides several commands from the
IEEEtran.cls file so that they can be used under other LaTeX classes. The
user guide provided here covers only the differences in the use of the
commands from those provided by IEEEtran.cls. For complete documentation
on these commands, see the relevant sections in the IEEEtran_HOWTO manual
of the IEEEtran LaTeX class, specifically the section covering IEEE-style
lists and the Appendix covering the IEEEeqnarray commands.

The IEEEtrantools.sty package provides the following IEEEtran.cls commands:

 1. \IEEEPARstart which produces large initial "drop cap" letters.

 2. the \bstctlcite command for the control entry types of IEEEtran.bst
    V1.00 and later

 3. the IEEE itemize, enumerate and description list environments

 4. the complete IEEEeqnarray family for producing multiline equations
    as well as matrices and tables, including the IEEEeqnarray support
    commands.

 5. The IEEEproof environment.
 
 6. \IEEEauthorrefmark{}

IEEEtrantools.sty is not needed and should not be used with IEEEtran.cls.
