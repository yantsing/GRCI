The jamming signal is assumed to be treated as noise at both the intended receiver and the eavesdropper. We obtain a closed-form expression for the structure of the artificial noise covariance matrix that guarantees a secrecy rate larger or at least equal to the secrecy capacity of the wiretap channel with no jamming signal. We also describe how to find specific realizations of this covariance matrix expression that provide good secrecy rate performance, even when there is no nontrivial null space between the helper and the intended receiver.

Given a fixed total bandwidth for the two feedback channels, the receiver must determine how to allocate its feedback bits to the transmitter and helper. Assuming zero-forcing transmission at the helper and random vector quantization of the channels, an analytic expression for the achievable ergodic secrecy rate due to the resulting quantization errors is derived. While direct optimization of the secrecy rate is difficult, an approximate upper bound for the mean loss in secrecy rate is derived and a feedback bit allocation method that minimizes the average upper bound on the secrecy rate loss is studied. A closed-form solution is shown to be possible if the integer constraint on the bit allocation is relaxed. Numerical simulations indicate the significant advantage that can be achieved by adaptively allocating the available feedback bits.},

	abstract = {Secure communications can be impeded by eavesdroppers in conventional relay systems. This paper proposes cooperative jamming strategies for two-hop relay networks where the eavesdropper can wiretap the relay channels in both hops. In these approaches, the normally inactive nodes in the relay network can be used as cooperative jamming sources to confuse the eavesdropper. Linear precoding schemes are investigated for two scenarios where single or multiple data streams are transmitted via a decode-and-forward (DF) relay, under the assumption that global channel state information (CSI) is available. For the case of single data stream transmission, we derive closed-form jamming beamformers and the corresponding optimal power allocation. Generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD)-based secure relaying schemes are proposed for the transmission of multiple data streams. The optimal power allocation is found for the GSVD relaying scheme via geometric programming. Based on this result, a GSVD-based cooperative jamming scheme is proposed that shows significant improvement in terms of secrecy rate compared to the approach without jamming. Furthermore, the case involving an eavesdropper with unknown CSI is also investigated in this paper. Simulation results show that the secrecy rate is dramatically increased when inactive nodes in the relay network participate in cooperative jamming.},

	doi = {10.1109/TSP.2009.2038412},
	abstract = {Physical (PHY) layer security approaches for wireless communications can prevent eavesdropping without upper layer data encryption. However, they are hampered by wireless channel conditions: absent feedback, they are typically feasible only when the source-destination channel is better than the source-eavesdropper channel. Node cooperation is a means to overcome this challenge and improve the performance of secure wireless communications. This paper addresses secure communications of one source-destination pair with the help of multiple cooperating relays in the presence of one or more eavesdroppers. Three cooperative schemes are considered: decode-and-forward (DF), amplify-and-forward (AF), and cooperative jamming (CJ). For these schemes, the relays transmit a weighted version of a reencoded noise-free message signal (for DF), a received noisy source signal (for AF), or a common jamming signal (for CJ). Novel system designs are proposed, consisting of the determination of relay weights and the allocation of transmit power, that maximize the achievable secrecy rate subject to a transmit power constraint, or, minimize the transmit power subject to a secrecy rate constraint. For DF in the presence of one eavesdropper, closed-form optimal solutions are derived for the relay weights. For other problems, since the optimal relay weights are difficult to obtain, several criteria are considered leading to suboptimal but simple solutions, i.e., the complete nulling of the message signals at all eavesdroppers (for DF and AF), or the complete nulling of jamming signal at the destination (for CJ). Based on the designed relay weights, for DF in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers, and for CJ in the presence of one eavesdropper, the optimal power allocation is obtained in closed-form; in all other cases the optimal power allocation is obtained via iterative algorithms. Numerical evaluation of the obtained secrecy rate and transmit power results show that the proposed design ca- - n significantly improve the performance of secure wireless communications.},

Two different cooperation schemes are considered. In the first scheme, cooperating nodes retransmit a weighted version of the source signal in a decode-and-forward (DF) fashion. In the second scheme, referred to as cooperative jamming (CJ), while the source is transmitting, cooperating nodes transmit weighted noise to confound the eavesdropper. We investigate two objectives: i) maximization of the achievable secrecy rate subject to a total power constraint and ii) minimization of the total power transmit power under a secrecy rate constraint. For the first design objective, we obtain the exact solution for the DF scheme for the case of a single or multiple eavasdroppers, while for the CJ scheme with a single eavesdropper we reduce the multivariate problem to a problem of one variable. For the second design objective, existing work introduces additional constraints in order to reduce the degree of difficulty, thus resulting in suboptimal solutions. Our work raises those constraints, and obtains either an analytical solution for the DF scheme with a single eavesdropper, or reduces the multivariate problem to a problem of one variable for the CJ scheme with a single eavesdropper. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the proposed results and compare them to existing work.},

	abstract = {Secure transmission techniques have been receiving growing attention in recent years, as a viable, powerful alternative to blocking eavesdropping attempts in an open wireless medium. This paper proposes a secret transmit beamforming approach using a quality-of-service (QoS)-based perspective. Specifically, we establish design formulations that: i) constrain the maximum allowable signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios (SINRs) of the eavesdroppers, and that ii) provide the intended receiver with a satisfactory SINR through either a guaranteed SINR constraint or SINR maximization. The proposed designs incorporate a relatively new idea called artificial noise (AN), where a suitable amount of AN is added in the transmitted signal to confuse the eavesdroppers. Our designs advocate joint optimization of the transmit weights and AN spatial distribution in accordance with the channel state information (CSI) of the intended receiver and eavesdroppers. Our formulated design problems are shown to be NP-hard in general. We deal with this difficulty by using semidefinite relaxation (SDR), an approximation technique based on convex optimization. Interestingly, we prove that SDR can exactly solve the design problems for a practically representative class of problem instances; e.g., when the intended receiver's instantaneous CSI is known. Extensions to the colluding-eavesdropper scenario and the multi-intended-receiver scenario are also examined. Extensive simulation results illustrate that the proposed AN-aided designs can yield significant power savings or SINR enhancement compared to some other methods.},

The communication is assisted by multiple multiantenna helpers that transmit noise to confound the eavesdropper. First, we consider a nulling scheme, in which each helper independently transmits noise, designed to maximize the system secrecy rate while creating no interference to the destination. In this scheme, each helper requires only local relay-destination channel state information (CSI). When global CSI is available at the relays, the nulling scheme is not optimal. The optimal jamming noise structure is also provided under global CSI. Interestingly, it is shown both analytically and via simulations that, despite its reduced CSI requirements, the nulling scheme may have secrecy rate performance that is very close to the optimal one. The probability of outage of the nulling scheme is provided in closed form based on the statistics of the eavesdropper CSI.},

Assuming zero-forcing transmission at the helper and random Secrecy wireless information and power

While direct optimization of the secrecy rate is difficult, an approximate upper bound for the mean loss in secrecy rate is derived and a feedback bit allocation method that minimizes the average upper bound on the secrecy rate loss is studied.

This paper considers the scenario of an intended multi-input single-output channel overheard by multiple multi-antenna eavesdroppers. Specifically, we address the transmit covariance optimization for secrecy-rate maximization (SRM) of that scenario. The challenge of this problem is that it is a nonconvex optimization problem. This paper shows that the SRM problem can actually be solved in a convex and tractable fashion, by recasting the SRM problem as a semidefinite program (SDP). The SRM problem we solve is under the premise of perfect channel state information (CSI). This paper also deals with the imperfect CSI case. We consider a worst-case robust SRM formulation under spherical CSI uncertainties, and we develop an optimal solution to it, again via SDP. Moreover, our analysis reveals that transmit beamforming is generally the optimal transmit strategy for SRM of the considered scenario, for both the perfect and imperfect CSI cases. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the secrecy-rate performance gains of the proposed SDP solutions compared to some suboptimal transmit designs.},
